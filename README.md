# Hack Technology / Project Attempted
I will be building a personal portfolio website in React / JS

## What you built? 

I had been meaning to build a personal website for a while, but I never had the time. I had also wanted to learn react for a while, and decided to kill two birds with one stone, building a porfolio / design website. 

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

I (Ethan) worked on everything

## What you learned

I learned quite a bit about CSS, flexboxes, and formatting. Much of what I learned in Figma was applicable, but figuring out how to build it in React / JS / CSS was a unique challenge.
